### **Project Title: Frontend MVP for "Catalyster" Crowdfunding Platform**

**Project Goal:**
To build a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) frontend for "Catalyster," an existing Instagram-style crowdfunding platform. The backend API is already developed, deployed, and documented. Your primary task is to review the existing (but broken) frontend code, identify non-functional endpoints, and implement the critical user flows, with the highest priority on creating content (posts, campaigns) and processing payments.

**Backend Information:**
* **Live API Base URL:** `https://catalyster.onrender.com/api/v1`
* **Backend Technology:** Spring Boot (Java), PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (configured for INR currency)

**Technology Stack (Frontend):**
* **Framework:** React (using Hooks, Context API)
* **Routing:** `react-router-dom`
* **API Calls:** `axios` or `fetch`
* **Styling:** (Specify your styling library, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, or plain CSS)
* **Payment:** `@stripe/react-stripe-js` and `@stripe/stripe-js`

### **Key Responsibilities & Action Items:**

Your job is to act as the lead frontend developer. The current frontend is incomplete, and most "create" operations are not working.

**1. Review and Understand (Highest Priority):**
* **Review API Documentation:** I have attached the backend API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI spec or Postman collection). You *must* study this first to understand all available endpoints, required request bodies (JSON payloads), and authentication (JWT token) requirements.
* **Review Existing Code:** Analyze the current React project structure. Identify the components and services that are intended to handle user authentication, content creation, and payments.

**2. Implement Core "Create" Features (Critical):**
The current app fails when a user tries to create new content. You need to fix or implement these features:

* **Create Campaign (`/create-campaign`):**
    * Connect the "Create Campaign" form to the correct backend endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/campaigns`).
    * Ensure the form data (title, description, goal amount, images, etc.) is correctly formatted into the JSON payload required by the API.
    * Handle the API response and redirect to the new campaign's page on success.

* **Create Post (`/create-post`):**
    * Connect the "Create Post" form/modal to `POST /api/v1/posts`.
    * Ensure image/video uploads are handled correctly and the API request is successful.

* **Create Reel (`/create-reel`):**
    * Connect the "Create Reel" form/modal to `POST /api/v1/reels`.
    * Ensure video upload and data submission match the API documentation.

**3. Implement Stripe Payment Flow (Critical):**
This is the most important feature for a crowdfunding platform.

* **Create a Payment Service:** Modify the existing `paymentService` (or create a new one).
* **Initiate Payment:** On the "Fund Project" button click, your frontend must:
    1.  Make an authenticated API call to the backend to create a payment session (e.g., `POST /api/v1/payments/create-checkout`).
    2.  The request body must send the `campaignId` and `amount` (in INR).
* **Handle Redirect:**
    1.  The backend will respond with a Stripe Checkout session ID or URL.
    2.  Use the Stripe.js library (`@stripe/stripe-js`) to redirect the user to the secure Stripe Checkout page.
* **Handle Success/Cancel:** Create the success (`/payment-success`) and cancel (`/payment-cancel`) pages that Stripe will redirect to.

**4. Fix Authentication and Authorization:**
* Ensure that the JWT token received after login is correctly stored (in `localStorage` or `AuthContext`).
* Ensure that this token is automatically attached to the "Authorization" header (e.g., `Bearer <token>`) for all protected API requests (like creating posts or payments). This is likely the reason many endpoints are failing.

Please start by confirming your understanding of the API documentation and then outline your plan, beginning with the **Stripe Payment Flow** and the **Create Campaign** feature.
